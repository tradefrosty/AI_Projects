/**
 * The 8-Queens problem requires that 8 queens be placed on a board with 8 rows
 * and columns so that no queen occupies the same row, column or diagonal as
 * another queen. To solve this problem using the Hill-Climbing with random
 * restart algorithm, we must first generate a random starting state which
 * places a queen in a random row of each column. From there, we first check to
 * see if the state is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we
 * evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each columnâ€™s queen
 * through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of
 * those states. When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check
 * to see if any states were generated that have a lower heuristic value than
 * the current state. If a better state was not found, then we have reached the
 * local minima and must perform a random restart. If a better (lower heuristic)
 * state was found, then that state becomes the current state and the above
 * process is repeated on that state.
